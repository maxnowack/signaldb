# @signaldb/fs-primitives

This is the generic filesystem storage adapter for [SignalDB](https://github.com/maxnowack/signaldb). It's a abstract wrapper that makes it easier to develop file system adapters for SignalDB. SignalDB is a local-first JavaScript database with real-time sync, enabling optimistic UI with signal-based reactivity across multiple frameworks.

See https://signaldb.js.org/reference/fs-primitives/ for more information.
