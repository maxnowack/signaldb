# Using SignalDB with Svelte 5

This guide explains how to integrate SignalDB into a Svelte 5 project. You’ll learn how to set up SignalDB collections and use Svelte's runes to manage and display data.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you’re familiar with Svelte basics and have a Svelte 5 project ready to go. If you’re new to Svelte 5, you can take a look at the [Svelte 5 Documentation](https://svelte-5-preview.vercel.app/docs/introduction) to get started.

A basic understanding of signal-based reactivity will also be helpful. You can read more about it on the [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/#signals-and-reactivity) page and the [Svelte runes blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) to understand how reactivity works.

## Installation

First, you need to install SignalDB in your project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install @signaldb/core
```

As Svelte runes have to be used inline, there isn't an easy way to provide a prebuilt adapter. Therefore you have to add a few lines in your code to specify the adapter during collection initialization.

## Setting Up SignalDB

Once you’ve installed SignalDB, the next step is to set up your collections. Here's how you can define a `Posts` collection with a custom reactivity configuration for Svelte:

```js
<script>
  import { Collection } from "@signaldb/core";

  const Posts = new Collection({
    reactivity: {
      create() {
        let dep = $state(0);
        return {
          depend() {
            dep;
          },
          notify() {
            dep += 1;
          },
        };
      },
      isInScope: () => !!$effect.tracking(),
    },
  });

  let items = $state.raw([]);
  $effect(() => {
    const cursor = Posts.find({});
    items = cursor.fetch();

    return () => {
      cursor.cleanup();
    };
  });
</script>
```

This code sets up a `Posts` collection and enables reactivity using Svelte’s built-in reactivity features.

## Creating a Svelte Component

Now let's create a component that lists posts and allows the user to add new ones. Here's an example:

```svelte
<script>
  import { Collection } from "@signaldb/core";

  const Posts = new Collection({
    reactivity: {
      create() {
        let dep = $state(0);
        return {
          depend() {
            dep;
          },
          notify() {
            dep += 1;
          },
        };
      },
      isInScope: () => !!$effect.tracking(),
    },
  });

  let items = $state.raw([]);
  $effect(() => {
    const cursor = Posts.find({});
    items = cursor.fetch();

    return () => {
      cursor.cleanup();
    };
  });
</script>

<button onclick={() => Posts.insert({ title: 'Post', author: 'Author' })}>
  Add Post
</button>

<ul>
  {#each items as post}
    <li>
      <strong>{post.title}</strong> by {post.author}
    </li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reactivity Configuration**: We define the reactivity system inside the `Posts` collection, with `depend()` and `notify()` managing dependencies.
2. **Reactive Items List**: The `items` array is set using Svelte's reactivity system, and the component automatically updates when the `Posts` collection changes.
3. **UI Interaction**: Clicking the "Add Post" button inserts a new post into the `Posts` collection, which triggers the component to update.

## Web Worker Compatibility

When using SignalDB with Svelte 5 in applications that utilize web workers, the standard reactivity setup can fail in production builds. This happens because Svelte's runes like `$state` aren't defined in web worker contexts.

To solve this issue, you can create a dedicated adapter that works in both standard and web worker environments:

```js
import { createReactivityAdapter } from "@signaldb/core";

// Reusable adapter for Svelte reactivity
export function svelteReactivityAdapter() {
  // Check if we're in a web worker
  const isWebWorker =
    typeof self !== "undefined" &&
    typeof WorkerGlobalScope !== "undefined" &&
    self instanceof WorkerGlobalScope;

  if (isWebWorker) {
    return createReactivityAdapter({
      create() {
        return {
          depend() {
            // No-op in web worker
          },
          notify() {
            // No-op in web worker
          },
        };
      },
      isInScope: () => false,
    });
  } else {
    // Regular context, use Svelte's reactivity primitives
    return createReactivityAdapter({
      create() {
        let dep = $state(0);
        return {
          depend() {
            dep;
          },
          notify() {
            dep += 1;
          },
        };
      },
      isInScope: () => !!$effect.tracking(),
    });
  }
}
```

Then use this adapter in your collection setup:

```js
import { Collection } from "@signaldb/core";
import { svelteReactivityAdapter } from "./your-adapter-file";

const Posts = new Collection({
  reactivity: svelteReactivityAdapter(),
});
```

This approach ensures your SignalDB collections work properly both in the main thread and in web workers.

## Conclusion

You’ve now learned how to set up SignalDB in a Svelte project and create a reactive component to display and add posts. By leveraging Svelte’s reactivity, you can efficiently manage data and create dynamic user interfaces with SignalDB.

## Next Steps

Now that you’ve learned how to use SignalDB in Svelte, you maybe want to explore the possibilities how you can synchronize the data with your backend.
