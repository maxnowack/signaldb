# Collection

```ts
import { Collection } from '@signaldb/core'
```

The Collection class is designed to manage and manipulate collections of data in memory, with options for reactivity, transformations and persistence adapters. Collections are schemaless, meaning that you don't need to define a schema for your data before you start using it. This allows you to store any data you want without worrying about defining a schema first. However, it's recommended that you define a typescript interface for the documents in the collection, so that you can benefit from type safety when working with the data.

## Static Methods

### `setFieldTracking(enable: boolean)`

Enables or disables field tracking for all collections. See [Field-Level Reactivity](/queries/#field-level-reactivity) for more information.

### `batch(callback: () => void)`

If you need to execute many operations at once in multiple collections, you can use the global `Collection.batch()` method. This method will execute all operations inside the callback without rebuilding the index on every change.

### `getCollections()`

Returns an array of all collections that have been created.

### `onCreation(callback: (collection: Collection) => void)`

Registers a callback that will be called whenever a new collection is created. The callback will receive the newly created collection as an argument.

### `onDispose(callback: (collection: Collection) => void)`

Registers a callback that will be called whenever a collection is disposed. The callback will receive the disposed collection as an argument.

### `enableDebugMode()`

Enables debug mode for all collections. This will enable measurements for query timings and other debug information.

## Constructor

```js
const collection = new Collection<T, I, U>(options?: CollectionOptions<T, I, U>)
```

Constructs a new Collection object.

Parameters
* options (Optional): An object specifying various options for the collection. Options include:
  * name: An optional name for the collection to make it easier to identify. This name will also be used in the developer tools.
  * memory: A [MemoryAdapter](/core-concepts/#memory-adapters) for storing items in memory.
  * reactivity: A [ReactivityAdapter](/reactivity/) for enabling reactivity.
  * persistence: A [PersistenceAdapter](/data-persistence/) for enabling persistent storage.
  * transform: A transformation function to be applied to items. The document that should be transformed is passed as the only parameter. The function should return the transformed document (e.g. `(doc: T) => U`)
  * indices: An array of [IndexProvider](/reference/core/createindexprovider/) objects for creating indices on the collection.

## Methods

### `isReady()`

Resolves when the persistence adapter finished initializing  and the collection is ready to be used.
This is useful when you need to wait for the collection to be ready before executing any operations directly after creating it.

Example:
```ts
const collection = new Collection({ persistence: /* ... */ })
await collection.isReady()

collection.insert({ name: 'Item 1' })
// ...
```

### `find(selector?: Selector<T>, options?: Options)`

Returns a new [cursor object](/reference/core/cursor/) for the items in the collection that match a given selector and options.
Also check out the [queries section](/queries/).

Parameters
* `selector` (Optional): A function to filter items in the collection.
* `options` (Optional): Options for the cursor.

### `findOne(selector?: Selector<T>, options?: Options)`
Behaves the same like [`.find()`](#find-selector-selector-t-options-options) but doesn't return a cursor. Instead it will directly return the first found document.

### `insert(item: Omit<T, 'id'> & Partial<Pick<T, 'id'>>)`
Inserts an item into the collection and returns the ID of the newly inserted item.
Also check out the [data manipulation section](/data-manipulation/).

### `insertMany(items: Array<Omit<T, 'id'> & Partial<Pick<T, 'id'>>>)`
Inserts multiple items into the collection and returns the IDs of the newly inserted items.

Parameters
* `item`: The item to be inserted into the collection.

### `updateMany(selector: Selector<T>, modifier: Modifier<T>, options?: { upsert?: boolean })`

Updates multiple items in the collection that match a given selector with the specified modifier.
Also check out the [data manipulation section](/data-manipulation/).

Parameters
* `selector`: A function to filter items in the collection.
* `modifier`: An object describing how to modify the matching items.
* `options`: An object with additional options. Currently only `upsert` is supported, which will insert a document based on the modifier, if the selector doesn't match any documents.


### `updateOne(selector: Selector<T>, modifier: Modifier<T>, options?: { upsert?: boolean })`

Behaves the same like `.updateMany()` but only updates the first found document.

### `replaceOne(selector: Selector<T>, replacement: Omit<T, 'id'> & Partial<Pick<T, 'id'>>, options?: { upsert?: boolean })`

Replaces a single item in the collection that matches a given selector with the specified replacement.
Also check out the [data manipulation section](/data-manipulation/).

Parameters
* `selector`: A function to filter items in the collection.
* `replacement`: The new item that should replace the existing one.
* `options`: An object with additional options. Currently only `upsert` is supported, which will insert a document based on the replacement, if the selector doesn't match any documents.

### `removeMany(selector: Selector<T>)`

Removes multiple items from the collection that match a given selector.

Parameters
* `selector`: A function to filter items in the collection.

### `removeOne(selector: Selector<T>)`

Behaves the same like `.removeMany()` but only removes the first found document.

### `batch(callback: () => void)`

If you need to execute many operations at once, things can get slow as the index would be rebuild on every change to the collection. To prevent this, you can use the `.batch()` method. This method will execute all operations inside the callback without rebuilding the index on every change. If you need to batch updates of multiple collections, you can use the global `Collection.batch()` method.

```js
collection.batch(() => {
  collection.insert({ name: 'Item 1' })
  collection.insert({ name: 'Item 2' })
  // â€¦
})
```

### `dispose()`

Disposes the collection and all its resources. This will unregister the persistence adapter and clean up all internal data structures.

### `setFieldTracking(enabled: boolean)`

Enables or disables field tracking for the collection. See [Field-Level Reactivity](/queries/#field-level-reactivity) for more information.

## Events

The Collection class is equipped with a set of events that provide insights into the state and changes within the collection. These events, emitted by the class, can be crucial for implementing reactive behaviors and persistence management. Here is an overview of the events:

* `added`: Triggered when a new item is added to the collection. The event handler receives the added item as an argument.
* `changed`: Fired when an existing item in the collection undergoes modification. The event handler is passed the modified item.
* `removed`: Signaled when an item is removed or deleted from the collection. The event handler receives the removed item.
* `validate`: Emitted when an item should be validated. The event handler receives the item as an argument. Validate the item inside of the event handler and throw an error if the item is invalid. This will prevent the item from being inserted or updated.

In addition to that, the collection will fire events for each executed method. For example, if you call `.updateOne()`, the collection will fire an `updateOne` event. The event handler will receive the selector and the modifier as arguments.

* `find`: Emitted when the `find` method is called. The event handler receives the selector, options and the cursor as arguments.
* `findOne`: Triggered when the `findOne` method is called. The event handler receives the selector, options and the returned item as arguments.
* `insert`: Fired when the `insert` method is called. The event handler receives the inserted item as an argument.
* `updateMany`: Emitted when the `updateMany` method is called. The event handler receives the selector and the modifier as arguments.
* `updateOne`: Triggered when the `updateOne` method is called. The event handler receives the selector and the modifier as arguments.
* `replaceOne`: Emitted when the `replaceOne` method is called. The event handler receives the selector and the replacement as arguments.
* `removeMany`: Emitted when the `removeMany` method is called. The event handler receives the selector as an argument.
* `removeOne`: Triggered when the `removeOne` method is called. The event handler receives the selector as an argument.

In addition to these basic events, there are events related to persistence operations. These events are only emitted when a persistence adapter is used.

* `persistence.init`: Marks the initialization of the persistence adapter.
* `persistence.error`: Indicates an error during persistence operations. The event handler receives an Error object describing the error.
* `persistence.transmitted`: Triggered after successfully transmitting data to the persistence adapter.
* `persistence.received`: Signifies the reception of data from the persistence adapter.

These events empower developers to build dynamic and responsive applications by reacting to changes in the collection, facilitating synchronization with external data sources, and handling persistence-related events.
