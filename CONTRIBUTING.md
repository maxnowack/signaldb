## 💻 Setting up development environment

To set up a development environment, you need to have nodejs installed. Make sure that it is at least the current LTS version.
Then, install the dependencies, by running `npm install` in the root of the repository.

```sh
npm install
```

## ✏️ Make your changes

The repository is setup as a monorepo. This means that there are multiple packages in the repository. The important folders are `packages`, `examples` and `docs`.
All packages are in the `packages` folder. In the folder are some sub-folders to structurize the packages. The `examples` folder contains examples. The `docs` folder contains markdown files that are used to build the documentation website with `vitepress`.

- `docs`: Contains the documentation pages for SignalDB.
- `examples`: Contains all SignalDB examples.
- `packages`:
  - `base`: Contains all base packages of SignalDB.
    - `core`: Contains `@signaldb/core`
    - `sync`: Contains `@signaldb/sync`
  - `integrations`: Contains all integrations to frameworks like React for example.
  - `reactivity-adapters`: Contains all reactivity adapters of SignalDB.
  - `storage-adapters`: Contains all storage adapters of SignalDB.

## ✅ Committing your changes

SignalDB uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. Please make sure that your commit messages follow the conventions.

## 🧪 Running the tests

SignalDB uses `vitest` for testing. To run the tests, you can use the `npm test` command.

```sh
npm test
```

## 📊 100% coverage

SignalDB aims for 100% test coverage. If you add a new feature, please add tests for it and make sure that all additions are covered. You can check the test coverage by running `npm run coverage`. [codecov.io](https://app.codecov.io/gh/maxnowack/signaldb) will run automatically to check the coverage of your PR.

```sh
npm run coverage
```

Sometimes there are edge cases that are really hard to test. In that case, you can use `istanbul ignore` statements. Please explain why you have choosen to use them in your PR!

## 📝 Changelog

Please also add at least one entry to the `[Unreleased]` section in the `CHANGELOG.md` of the package you've changed. You'll find the `CHANGELOG.md` in the folder of the specific package, right next to the `package.json`. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

## 📚 Documentation

When you make changes to the API, please also update the documentation in the `docs` folder. The documentation is written in Markdown and uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) for rendering. There a some scripts in the root `package.json` to run or build the documentation. Use `npm run docs:dev` to start a local development server if you want to see how your changes look like.

```sh
npm run docs:dev
```

The documentation for v1 is not in this tree. It is built from the `v1.8.1` tag
into `docs/public/v1` by `npm run docs:build-v1`, which the deploy workflow runs
before the main build:

```sh
npm run docs:build-v1
```

You only need this if you are working on the v1 archive itself — the navigation
leaves its entry out when the directory is absent, so nothing links into the
void without it. The first run checks the tag out and builds it, which takes a
few minutes; every run after that copies from `.cache/v1-docs`. See
`.scripts/build-v1-docs.js` — the tag is the only thing to change there.
